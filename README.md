## What is Teeko?
Teeko is a game played between two players, each of which with 4 red or black pieces, on a 5x5 board. At the start of the game, the players with black pieces always starts, and then each player takes turns placing their pieces until all pieces have been placed on the board - I will refer to this initial sequence of dropping pieces as the <b>drop phase</b>.
